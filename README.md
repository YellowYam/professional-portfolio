## Readme notes
This is a work in progress. It's not going to be done until I've finished this course. Right now I'm hoping to add a project that will allow users to upload testable C programming
language material so that their program may be tested. And if it passess all the tests, then the application will give the user a special certification sticker to put on their 
GitHub profile. They will also be stored on the application's database.
